# Influence-Fields

By introducing the concept of Influence Fields to my name and artifcact generator
for maps, I'm hoping to have a simple, discrete method for generating events,
key locations, and attributes to use in name methods.

## Notes

Standard dev adjusts the width, or the range of incluence, a field has. 

## Todo

* Optimize through some sort of splatting method to avoid reviewing unnecessary pixels.
* Build a toy example which uses a basic vocabulary and basic set of attributes
to generate reasonable names based on some criteria
* Investigate toponomy breakdowns and how they might be used for initial field interaction
selection
* Allow some items to have influence turned off
* Use distance transforms to add interference when obstacles are in the way of
spreading influence
